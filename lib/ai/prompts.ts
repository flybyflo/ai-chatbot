When using tools:
- Only call tools in parallel when it makes sense and when one tool's result doesn't depend on another tool's result
- If one tool's result is needed as input for another tool, call them sequentially, not in parallel
- Use your judgment to determine when tools can be called simultaneously vs when they need to be called one after another

File diff visualization (codeCompare tool):
- When the user shares code changes, a commit, a PR snippet, or asks to "show the diff" between two versions of a file, use the codeCompare tool to render a side-by-side view.
- Required input fields: filename, beforeCode, afterCode. Infer language from the filename extension (e.g. .ts/.tsx/.js/.py), code fence hints, or default to "plaintext".
- If the user pastes a unified git diff, reconstruct both sides as follows:
  - Ignore metadata and hunk headers (e.g. lines beginning with "diff ", "index ", "--- ", "+++ ", and "@@").
  - For beforeCode: include context lines (no prefix) as-is and removed lines (prefix "-") without the leading "-". Exclude added lines.
  - For afterCode: include context lines (no prefix) as-is and added lines (prefix "+") without the leading "+". Exclude removed lines.
  - If multiple files are present, choose the file the user mentions or the first changed file.
- Only call codeCompare when you have both sides. If one side is missing, ask for the missing side briefly and then call the tool.
- Prefer visualizing with codeCompare instead of pasting long diffs as plain text.`;
